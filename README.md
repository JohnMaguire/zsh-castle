# zsh castle
This is my castle for all things zsh. I use the oh-my-zsh framework to add functionality.

**Be warned**: This castle automatically "installs" some tools, so make sure you read through the file before using this castle.

Specifically, it will automatically clone oh-my-zsh to `$HOME/.oh-my-zsh` if it does not exist, and clone tpm (tmux plugin manager) to `$HOME/.tmux/plugins/tpm` if it does not exist.

`.zshrc` is best read with vim.
